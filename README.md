# Messanger

Messenger is a scalable, real-time chat application built with Node.js, React.js, and ChatEngine.io. The app supports group chats, 1-on-1 chats, real-time messaging, image and file support, read receipts, and more!


## Features

- ### Group Chats
  Messenger supports group chats, allowing users to chat with multiple people at once. Users can create and join groups, and new messages in group chats will appear in   real-time for all group members.

- ### 1-on-1 Chats
  In addition to group chats, Messenger also supports 1-on-1 chats. Users can start a private chat with another user, and messages will appear in real-time for both    users.

- ### Real-time Messaging
  Messenger uses ChatEngine.io to provide real-time messaging capabilities. This means that new messages will appear in the chat without needing to refresh the page.

- ### Image and File Support
  Users can send images and files in Messenger. Images will be displayed in the chat, and files can be downloaded by clicking on the file link.

- ### Read Receipts
  Messenger provides read receipts for messages. Users can see when their messages have been read by other users in the chat.
